## Note For Running the App

To connect to your own database, navigate to the `Online-Store-App/Store-App/appsettings-template.json` template file, and create a copy of that file named `appsettings.json`. In the new `appsettings.json` file, enter your database connection string as the value for the `"ShoppingAppCon"` key.

The SQL scripts to create tables and dummy data can be found in the directory `Online-Store-App/Store-App/SQL_Scripts/`.
